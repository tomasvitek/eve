Do you organise regular seminars and need a simple way to advertise
upcoming seminars and their speakers?

`eve` provides an easy way to manage and render lists of both
upcoming and past events. `eve` also generates an **iCal feed** of
all upcoming events to enable attendees to subscribe to your events.
Lastly, `eve` provides an URL to **count number of interested attendees**.

`eve` uses [Nette](http://nette.org/) framework and is written in PHP.
